# SKYNEX Website Modernization Guide

## Overview of Changes

The SKYNEX website has been updated with a modern glassmorphism design that's perfect for SaaS and AI-focused startups. This guide explains how to run the updated website and understand the key changes.

## Running the Updated Website

1. **Clean your Next.js build and node_modules (recommended)**
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   rm -rf node_modules
   ```

2. **Reinstall dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   
4. **View the website**
   Open your browser to http://localhost:3000

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

If you encounter any issues with the updated design:

### Next.js Version Mismatch

The site is designed for Next.js 15.0.0. If you're seeing a version mismatch error:

```bash
npm install next@15.0.0 --save-exact
```

### Animation Issues

If animations are not working properly, ensure your tailwind.config.js has been properly updated with the new animation keyframes. Check that the following additions are present:

```js
animation: {
  'spin-slow': 'spin 8s linear infinite',
  'spin-reverse': 'spin-reverse 12s linear infinite',
  'float': 'float 6s ease-in-out infinite',
  'float-delayed': 'float 8s ease-in-out infinite 2s',
},
keyframes: {
  'spin-reverse': {
    '0%': { transform: 'rotate(0deg)' },
    '100%': { transform: 'rotate(-360deg)' },
  },
  'float': {
    '0%, 100%': { transform: 'translateY(0)' },
    '50%': { transform: 'translateY(-20px)' },
  },
},
```

### Dark Mode Not Applying

The new design enforces dark mode. If it's not correctly applying:

1. Check the script in `app/layout.tsx` that forces dark mode
2. Make sure `darkMode: 'class'` is in your tailwind.config.js
3. Try clearing your browser's local storage

## Key Files Modified

1. **Styling and Configuration:**
   - `tailwind.config.js` - Added new animations and utilities
   - `app/layout.tsx` - Updated to enforce dark mode

2. **Core Components:**
   - `components/Header.tsx` - Modern transparent header
   - `components/Footer.tsx` - Glassmorphism footer
   
3. **Page Templates:**
   - `app/page.tsx` - Completely redesigned homepage

## Design Principles

The redesign follows several key modern design principles:

1. **Glassmorphism** - Frosted glass effects with backdrop-blur and transparency
2. **Depth and Layering** - Multiple visual layers with floating elements
3. **Gradients and Accents** - Vibrant color gradients for visual hierarchy
4. **Animation** - Subtle animations that enhance rather than distract

## Additional Recommendations

To further improve the website:

1. Apply the same design principles to other pages (tools, about, contact)
2. Consider adding a dark/light mode toggle if needed
3. Optimize images for performance using Next.js Image component with proper sizing
4. Add more microinteractions for interactive elements
5. Implement subtle page transition animations
